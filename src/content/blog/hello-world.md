This is my first blog post. Welcome to my blog!

## Getting Started

You can write markdown here with all the usual formatting:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `inline code`

```js
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a place to share my thoughts on programming, technology, and other things I find interesting. Writing helps me think through problems and document what I learn.

## What's Next

I plan to write about web development, systems programming, and open source projects I'm working on. Stay tuned for more posts!
