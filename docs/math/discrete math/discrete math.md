### Unit 1: Proofs

Proof: A _mathematical proof_ of a _proposition_ is a chain of logical deductions leading to the proposition from a base set of _axioms_.

Let $f\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t)\,dt$. Then $F$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that  $f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.
