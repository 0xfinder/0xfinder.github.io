Education has become so rigid and stale that it just instantly stood out to me, or maybe I became more aware? They don\u2019t teach about you why you should learn, they teach you what they want you to learn. A rather big contrast from what you want to learn. While what you want to learn may not be optimal due to imperfect information, I still believe we should have the freedom, and even so, schools should start teaching you about the importance of learning. Besides that, I think moving away from boring rote learning is key to enriching learning experiences, spurring students (I don\u2019t particularly like this word) to learn more.\nFast forward to the second year and it was pretty much the same as the first. Though, for some reason I started actually trying to get good grades, maybe it was the urgency, the fear that I didn\u2019t have a backup plan if I could not enter university, not wanting to be at a loss if I can\u2019t get into the course I want. I tried studying and it... didn\u2019t go well. As much as I hated studying, hated being a cog in society, I didn\u2019t know what to do, where to go. I studied but nothing was going in, I gradually lost interest in studying (again.) I was so repulsed by large chunks of text that it impacted my reading.

So it wasn't all that bad, but I wasn't sure if it'd be as productive as I wanted it to be. That said, it was still worth a shot. And hey, programming is pretty fun after all. I went online and did some research on computer science courses, took a free one (CS50x), completed it and was pretty satisfied with what I had just learnt and achieved. After that, I went on to write scripts to grind discord bots and sell the currency, for some extra pocket money, and basically botted a few games. It was fun but, started to get boring, especially with how many bans I had amassed after a month or two. Maybe it was fate, but a friend of mine I met online quite a long while ago hit me up and invited me to collaborate on a discord bot, written in Javascript, using Discord.JS.

So yes, after some Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V shenanigans, I actually made a command, hooray. It went the same way for the second command, and after working on more feature improvements and new commands, I gradually got to understand the codebase and how it all came together. It was pretty painful but fun, and it kept me occupied so no complaints. I had learnt about databases and structuring code which was pretty cool in my opinion. And after a month or so working on the bot, I decided to pickup new stuff. Javascript seemed really nice to code in compared to python, I love the syntax, but then... I discovered Typescript. Admittedly, it was pretty confusing and seemed unnecessary, but then the convenience of having types allowing mistakes to be found in your code before runtime was a real game changer.
