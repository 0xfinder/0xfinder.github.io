    <h1>quotes from house of cards</h1>

    <p>"masterpiece" is often thrown around, used by many to describe outstanding works, but how much of it is truly
        worthy of that title? the critically acclaimed house of cards is in and of itself, the very essence of a
        masterpiece. with the first season released in 2013, house of cards tells the story of a democrat house majority
        whip and his wife, claire underwood, chairwoman of the clean water institute. a betrayal which caused him to
        lose the appointment of secretary of state fuels him with hatred to enact an insidious plan to climb the ranks,
        aided by his confidantes claire and right-hand man doug stamper. a captivating story about ruthless pragmatism,
        manipulation, betrayal, and power.</p>
