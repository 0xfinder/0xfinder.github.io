I just couldn\\u2019t fall asleep - I left my face exposed and it was too cold, I tried covering myself totally with blankets but it was too hot. I couldn\\u2019t reach the perfect coolness.

I only ever had extra tuition for languages before (Chinese or English) so I\\u2019ve never considered it but my mother asked if I\\u2019d like math tuition.

The joy of learning was long gone from me, it wasn\\u2019t like it was back in elementary school. I started to feel like a robot being mass produced in a factory, operated by robots I was soon to become. Education has become so rigid and stale that it just instantly stood out to me, or maybe I became more aware? They don\\u2019t teach about you why you should learn, they teach you what they want you to learn. A rather big contrast from what you want to learn. While what you want to learn may not be optimal due to imperfect information, I still believe we should have the freedom, and even so, schools should start teaching you about the importance of learning. Besides that, I think moving away from boring rote learning is key to enriching learning experiences, spurring students (I don\\u2019t particularly like this word) to learn more.\\nFast forward to the second year and it was pretty much the same as the first. Though, for some reason I started actually trying to get good grades, maybe it was the urgency, the fear that I didn\\u2019t have a backup plan if I could not enter university, not wanting to be at a loss if I can\\u2019t get into the course I want. I tried studying and it\\u2026 didn\\u2019t go well. As much as I hated studying, hated being a cog in society, I didn\\u2019t know what to do, where to go. I studied but nothing was going in, I gradually lost interest in studying (again.) I was so repulsed by large chunks of text that it impacted my reading. When I read anything, I just couldn\\u2019t understand the text, no matter how slowly I read. All I saw were letters, I could read words but I couldn\\u2019t make anything of them. I read and re-read a dozen times but nothing entered my head.

(yes, everything) If you didn\\u2019t know, tuition centres really thrive here, so they\\u2019re pretty expensive. I didn\\u2019t know what to do since I hated burdening my parents with tuition fees. I knew the tuition wasn\\u2019t helping especially since literally nothing was going into my brain, but I felt this strong reliance on tuition that I just couldn\\u2019t say no. As months went by, I still tried studying, and the stress of knowing that a couple grand a month were being spent for useless tuition started piling on me. I felt utterly hopeless, I told my parents and they didn\\u2019t mind (I\\u2019m really grateful for this and appreciate it), but it still didn\\u2019t relieve my stress.

I tried to feign illness to skip tuition, but even with the free time I felt so lost. I had planned to stop and think about what I wanted to do but nothing came to mind.

I still couldn\\u2019t find the joy in learning I had lost long ago. Leading up to the actual exams I didn\\u2019t study at all, but I didn\\u2019t play games either. I just tried to think but I probably was not in the right mind to do so. And well, for the exams my score was the school\\u2019s average, so not too shabby, I guess. But for a city that\\u2019s so competitive, my dream course (Computer Science) was definitely a no-no. When I got my results about a month ago it didn\\u2019t hit me as hard as I expected it to be. I mentally prepared myself to fail every subject but deep down inside, I still had hope that I could get a decent score and make my parents happy, especially after all the care and money they\\u2019ve given, and spent on me.

Probably coping but every CS course now is basically machine learning, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity which aren\\u2019t my interests at all. So it wasn\\u2019t all that bad, but I wasn\\u2019t sure if it\\u2019d be as productive as I wanted it to be. That said, it was still worth a shot. And hey, programming is pretty fun after all. I went online and did some research on computer science courses, took a free one (CS50x), completed it and was pretty satisfied with what I had just learnt and achieved. After that, I went on to write scripts to grind discord bots and sell the currency, for some extra pocket money, and basically botted a few games. It was fun but, started to get boring, especially with how many bans I had amassed after a month or two. Maybe it was fate, but a friend of mine I met online quite a long while ago hit me up and invited me to collaborate on a discord bot, written in Javascript, using Discord.JS. Well that\\u2019s pretty darn cool, I haven\\u2019t done much in Javascript so I was wondering if I could even contribute anything, but hey, it\\u2019s an opportunity to learn a new language so why not?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A day or two had passed and I was still looking through the tens of commands in the existing code and damn were they hard to understand. I was pretty demoralized when I saw the task list and there was nothing I knew how to do. A short while later I was assigned a command similar to an existing one, just serving the opposite purpose. So yes, after some Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V shenanigans, I actually made a command, hooray. It went the same way for the second command, and after working on more feature improvements and new commands, I gradually got to understand the codebase and how it all came together. It was pretty painful but fun, and it kept me occupied so no complaints. I had learnt about databases and structuring code which was pretty cool in my opinion. And after a month or so working on the bot, I decided to pickup new stuff. Javascript seemed really nice to code in compared to python, I love the syntax, but then\\u2026 I discovered Typescript. Admittedly, it was pretty confusing and seemed unnecessary, but then the convenience of having types allowing mistakes to be found in your code before runtime was a real game changer.

I definitely don\\u2019t think I did well at school. Could I have done better? Yes. Would I have done better? Probably not. I am still unable to convince myself that school was fun, even now.
